      <h1>About Me<h1>
      <br>
      <p>I'm a Product Manager who builds products by putting user problems first - not features, not technology, but the actual challenges people face.</p>
      <br>
      <p>My journey into product management started with curiosity about how successful products are built. I wanted to understand what goes into creating products that users love and keep coming back to.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Through my work and learning, I discovered that great products come from deeply understanding user problems and solving them in ways that feel intuitive and valuable. This realization shaped how I approach every product decision.</p>
      <br>
      <p>My approach is research-driven and outcome-focused. I start by deeply understanding users through interviews, surveys, and data analysis. I don't assume I know what users need. I validate through evidence.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I'm obsessed with the "why" behind user behavior. Data tells me what's happening, but research tells me why. I build empathy maps, user flows, and personas not as deliverables, but as tools to make better decisions.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>What drives me? </b><br><br>
        Building products that genuinely improve people's lives. I'm energized by solving complex problems with simple, elegant solutions. I want to work on products where getting it right matters, where users trust what we build and where our decisions have measurable impact.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Core Skills: Product Strategy & Roadmapping, User Research & Empathy, Product Lifecycle Management, Data-Driven Prioritization, Agile/Scrum, Go-to-Market (GTM) Planning.</p>
